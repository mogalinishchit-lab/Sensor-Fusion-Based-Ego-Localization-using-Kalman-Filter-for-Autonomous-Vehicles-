# Sensor-Fusion-Based-Ego-Localization-using-Kalman-Filter-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-
This project fuses NEO-6M GPS and MPU-6050 IMU data using a Kalman filter to enhance position, velocity, and orientation estimation. By mitigating sensor inaccuracies, it delivers more reliable tracking, supporting applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and spatial monitoring.
